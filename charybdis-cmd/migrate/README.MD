## Automatic migration with `charybdis_cmd/migrate`:
<a name="automatic-migration"></a>
Smart migration tool that enables automatic migration to database without need to write migrations by hand.
It expects `src/models` files and generates migrations based on differences between model definitions and database.

It supports following operations:
- Create new tables
- Create new columns
- Drop columns
- Create secondary indexes
- Drop secondary indexes
- Create UDTs (`src/models/udts`)
- Create materialized views (`src/models/materialized_views`)
- Table options
  ```rust
    #[charybdis_model(
        table_name = commits,
        partition_keys = [object_id],
        clustering_keys = [created_at, id],
        global_secondary_indexes = [],
        local_secondary_indexes = [],
        table_options = #r"
            WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (created_at DESC) 
            AND gc_grace_seconds = 86400
        ";
    )]
    #[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Default)]
    pub struct Commit {
    ```
  ‚ö†Ô∏è If table exists, table options will result in alter table query that without
  `CLUSTERING ORDER` and `COMPACT STORAGE` options.

üü¢ Tables, Types and UDT dropping is not added. If you don't define model within `src/model` dir
it will leave db structure as it is.
```bash
cargo install charybdis_cmd/migrate

migrate --hosts <host> --keyspace <your_keyspace>
```

‚ö†Ô∏è If you are working with **existing** datasets, before running migration you need to make sure that your **model**
definitions structure matches the database in respect to table names, column names, column types, partition keys,
clustering keys and secondary indexes so you don't alter structure accidentally.
If structure is matched, it will not run any migrations. As mentioned above,
in case there is no model definition for table, it will **not** drop it. In future,
we will add `modelize` command that will generate `src/models` files from existing data source.

### Define Tables

Declare model as a struct within `src/models` dir:
```rust
// src/modles/user.rs
#[charybdis_model(
    table_name = users,
    partition_keys = [id],
    clustering_keys = [],
    global_secondary_indexes = [],
    local_secondary_indexes = [],
)]
pub struct User {
    pub id: Uuid,
    pub username: Text,
    pub email: Text,
    pub created_at: Timestamp,
    pub updated_at: Timestamp,
    pub address: Address,
}
```
(Note we use `src/models` as automatic migration tool expects that dir)

### Define UDT
Declare udt model as a struct within `src/models/udts` dir:
```rust
// src/models/udts/address.rs
#[charybdis_udt_model(type_name = address)]
pub struct Address {
    pub street: Text,
    pub city: Text,
    pub state: Option<Text>,
    pub zip: Text,
    pub country: Text,
}
```

### Materialized Views
Declare view model as a struct within `src/models/materialized_views` dir:

```rust
use charybdis::*;

#[charybdis_view_model(
    table_name=users_by_username,
    base_table=users,
    partition_keys=[username],
    clustering_keys=[id]
)]
pub struct UsersByUsername {
    pub username: Text,
    pub id: Uuid,
    pub email: Text,
    pub created_at: Timestamp,
    pub updated_at: Timestamp,
}

```
Resulting auto-generated migration query will be:
```cassandraql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW IF NOT EXISTS users_by_email
AS SELECT created_at, updated_at, username, email, id
FROM users
WHERE email IS NOT NULL AND id IS NOT NULL
PRIMARY KEY (email, id)
  ```
